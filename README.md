## why?
You have found a seed you like, but want to add some variation to it? This is the extension for you!

All of this can be done in countless other ways, but this is the way I like it. Maybe you like it too.

<hr>

## some infos
some of the default values can be changed in the settings.

# Important

**It works with [DynamicPrompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts), but make sure, that the folder name of this extension is after the folder name of DynamicPrompts in alphabetical order. Thats why this repos name starts with a 'z'.**
