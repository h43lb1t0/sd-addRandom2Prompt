# sd-addRandom2Prompt

## What is this?
This extension adds a random string to your prompt. 
Choose between only letters, only numbers or both.
Put the random string at the beginning, at the end or somewhere random in your prompt.

## why?
You have found a seed you like, but want to add some variation to it? This is the extension for you!

All of this can be done in countless other ways, but this is the way I like it. Maybe you like it too.

<hr>

## some infos
some of the default values can be changed in the settings.

It does not *break* DynamicPrompts, but use these two extensions together at your own risk.
**Disabling DynamicPrompts to get the correct info texts displayed.**
